# Changelog

## Version 0.14.3 (2026-01-18)

- Update NPM dependencies
- Add support for latest OpenAI models

## Version 0.14.2 (2025-11-07)

- Fix bug in demonstration interpreter.

## Version 0.14.1 (2025-11-05)

- Fix bug in inference spending computations.

## Version 0.14.0 (2025-11-05)

- VSCode Extension: when a test is stuck on a query, a new command allows seeing diffs with all unreachable queries of the same type, which is very useful for repairing demonstrations after a strategy change.
- Add `delphyne browse` command for generating browsable traces from raw traces.
- Add `Run` nodes that subclass `Branch` for extracting a single element from an opaque space without branching.
- **Breaking**: Overhaul example selectors for better flexibility (see `select_examples` argument of `few_shot`).
- **Breaking**: Overhaul `Stream` to make it an iterable directly and remove `Stream.gen`.
- **Breaking**: Overhaul the `Experiment` class to make it more ergonomic.
- Implement support for embeddings and embedding-based example retrieval (including the standard MMR algorithm).
- Remove `auto_reload` setting, which is fundamentally unsafe.
- Experimental: add support for feedback backpropagation.
- Add `init` key to `delphyne.yaml` to register custom initializers.
- Remove automatic reloading of Python modules, which is very error prone. Users should manually restart the server instead.
- Allow replaying failing experiment configurations in a debugger.

## Version 0.13.0 (2025-09-27)

- **Breaking**: Change signature of `dp.compute` to allow passing additional keyword arguments. You must now write `dp.compute(fun)(*args, **kwargs)` instead of `dp.compute(fun, *args, **kwargs)`.
- Add `override_args` argument to `dp.compute` and `dp.elim_compute`. This allows policies to override timeout arguments for tool calls.
- Add `elim_values` and `binarize_values` tree transformers.
- Add new policy for handling `Abduction` nodes: `abduct_recursively`.
- Add a `Data` effect for loading evolving external data.
- Fix summary generation bug in experiment launcher.

## Version 0.12.0 (2025-09-24)

- Add a `take` test instruction to the demonstration language for manually specifying an action to take at a given node. This ensures that the demonstration language is complete (any success node can be reached via a demonstration).
- **Breaking**: improve navigation function for `Abduction` nodes to make it (conditionally) invertible.
- Add `workers_setup` argument to `Experiment`.
- **Experimental**: add support for external answer sources in demonstrations and in the `run_strategy` command, and for hindsight feedback.
- Fix path bug in experiment launcher.

## Version 0.11.1 (2025-09-13)

- **Breaking**: `Experiment` puts all config folders in a `configs` subdirectory of the output directory.
- Fix JSON serialization bug when using `Execute Command` from the extension.

## Version 0.10.0 (2025-09-07)

- **Breaking**: improve logging system, by supporting log levels and filtering. The `dp.log` function is removed: `dp.PolicyEnv` must be used instead.
- Add `interactive` option to experiment launcher, allowing to obtain a snapshot of ongoing tasks at any time by pressing Enter.
- Automatically add time information in logs.
- Logging now supports arbitrary serializable metadata.
- Fix a deprecation warning on Python 3.13.
- Fix a bug in `delphyne check`.

## Version 0.9.2 (2025-09-03)

- Various improvements on `standard_model`:
  - Handle snapshot suffixes (e.g. `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`) when inferring model provider or pricing.
  - Avoid silent failures of infering model pricing.

## Version 0.9.1 (2025-09-02)

- **Breaking**: simplified and optimized the request caching mechanism. Only one caching backend is now available, which uses an in-memory dictionary that is dumped as a YAML file on closing.

## Version 0.8.0 (2025-09-02)

### Changes

- Moved `PolicyEnv` from `core` to the standard library and make `AbstractPolicy` parametric in the policy environment type. As a consequence, the `PolicyEnv.__init__.make_cache` argument can be removed.

### New Features

- Added support for standard library templates (e.g. stdlib/format).
- Parsers can emit formatting hints to be rendered by prompt templates.
- Initial implementation of _universal queries_. See new `guess` export and `test_program.py::test_make_sum_using_guess`.
- Added Gemini Integration.
- Completed a first version of the user documentation.

## Version 0.7.0 (2025-08-22)

- **Breaking:** overhaul of parsers in the standard library. Parsers are now simpler and more composable. In particular, it is now possible to transform parsers by mapping a function to their results or adding validators. Some (partial) upgrading instructions:
  - Replace `raw_yaml` by `get_text.yaml`.
  - Replace `yaml_from_last_code_block` by `last_code_block.yaml`.
  - Replace the `"structured"` parser spec by `structured`.
  - Replace the `"structured"` parser spec by `structured`.
  - Look at the new signature for `Query.__parser__` and at the new methods `Query.parser` and `Query.parser_for`, which replace `Query.query_config`.

## Version 0.6.1 (2025-08-19)

First released version with a full API Reference documentation. From this version on, Delphyne adheres to semantic versioning.
