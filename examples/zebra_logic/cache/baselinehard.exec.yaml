                  Convert a single `clue` from a Zebra logic puzzle into Z3 constraints. The
                  uniqueness contraints from `context` are already encoded in the solver.
                  Each variable from `variable_names` is of type z3.Int() and
                  available for use in your output snippet. A value of a variable is the
                  number of the house that object occupies. Additionally, note that
                  `previous_snippets` are used for formalizing previous clues, and `step`
                  indicates the index of the current clue being formalized (0-based).

                  Return Python code wrapped in a triple-backtick block. The code must define
                  a list named `constraints` containing z3.BoolRef (if there is only one
                  constraint, then it is a one-element list) capturing only the information
                  from the provided clue. Do not modify the solver or call `check`. You must
                  prepend `z3.` to all Z3 API calls. Do not include any import statements.

                  Convert a single `clue` from a Zebra logic puzzle into Z3 constraints. The
                  uniqueness contraints from `context` are already encoded in the solver.
                  Each variable from `variable_names` is of type z3.Int() and
                  available for use in your output snippet. A value of a variable is the
                  number of the house that object occupies. Additionally, note that
                  `previous_snippets` are used for formalizing previous clues, and `step`
                  indicates the index of the current clue being formalized (0-based).

                  Return Python code wrapped in a triple-backtick block. The code must define
                  a list named `constraints` containing z3.BoolRef (if there is only one
                  constraint, then it is a one-element list) capturing only the information
                  from the provided clue. Do not modify the solver or call `check`. You must
                  prepend `z3.` to all Z3 API calls. Do not include any import statements.

                  Convert a single `clue` from a Zebra logic puzzle into Z3 constraints. The
                  uniqueness contraints from `context` are already encoded in the solver.
                  Each variable from `variable_names` is of type z3.Int() and
                  available for use in your output snippet. A value of a variable is the
                  number of the house that object occupies. Additionally, note that
                  `previous_snippets` are used for formalizing previous clues, and `step`
                  indicates the index of the current clue being formalized (0-based).

                  Return Python code wrapped in a triple-backtick block. The code must define
                  a list named `constraints` containing z3.BoolRef (if there is only one
                  constraint, then it is a one-element list) capturing only the information
                  from the provided clue. Do not modify the solver or call `check`. You must
                  prepend `z3.` to all Z3 API calls. Do not include any import statements.

                  Convert a single `clue` from a Zebra logic puzzle into Z3 constraints. The
                  uniqueness contraints from `context` are already encoded in the solver.
                  Each variable from `variable_names` is of type z3.Int() and
                  available for use in your output snippet. A value of a variable is the
                  number of the house that object occupies. Additionally, note that
                  `previous_snippets` are used for formalizing previous clues, and `step`
                  indicates the index of the current clue being formalized (0-based).

                  Return Python code wrapped in a triple-backtick block. The code must define
                  a list named `constraints` containing z3.BoolRef (if there is only one
                  constraint, then it is a one-element list) capturing only the information
                  from the provided clue. Do not modify the solver or call `check`. You must
                  prepend `z3.` to all Z3 API calls. Do not include any import statements.

                    There are 4 houses, numbered 1 to 4 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:
                    - Each person has a unique name: `Alice`, `Eric`, `Arnold`, `Peter`
                    - Each person has an occupation: `artist`, `engineer`, `teacher`, `doctor`
                    - People have unique favorite book genres: `fantasy`, `science fiction`, `mystery`, `romance`
                    - People use unique phone models: `google pixel 6`, `iphone 13`, `oneplus 9`, `samsung galaxy s21`
                  clue: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is Arnold.

                  Each variable from `variable_names` is of type z3.Int() and
                  available for use in your output snippet. A value of a variable is the

                    There are 4 houses, numbered 1 to 4 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:
                    - Each person has a unique name: `Alice`, `Eric`, `Arnold`, `Peter`
                    - Each person has an occupation: `artist`, `engineer`, `teacher`, `doctor`
                    - People have unique favorite book genres: `fantasy`, `science fiction`, `mystery`, `romance`
                    - People use unique phone models: `google pixel 6`, `iphone 13`, `oneplus 9`, `samsung galaxy s21`
                  clue: Eric is the person who is a teacher.

                    There are 4 houses, numbered 1 to 4 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:
                    - Each person has a unique name: `Alice`, `Eric`, `Arnold`, `Peter`
                    - Each person has an occupation: `artist`, `engineer`, `teacher`, `doctor`

                    There are 4 houses, numbered 1 to 4 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:
                    - Each person has a unique name: `Alice`, `Eric`, `Arnold`, `Peter`
                    - Each person has an occupation: `artist`, `engineer`, `teacher`, `doctor`
                    - People have unique favorite book genres: `fantasy`, `science fiction`, `mystery`, `romance`
                    - People use unique phone models: `google pixel 6`, `iphone 13`, `oneplus 9`, `samsung galaxy s21`
                  clue: The person who loves science fiction books is somewhere to the left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.

                    There are 4 houses, numbered 1 to 4 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:
                    - Each person has a unique name: `Alice`, `Eric`, `Arnold`, `Peter`
                    - Each person has an occupation: `artist`, `engineer`, `teacher`, `doctor`
                    - People have unique favorite book genres: `fantasy`, `science fiction`, `mystery`, `romance`
                    - People use unique phone models: `google pixel 6`, `iphone 13`, `oneplus 9`, `samsung galaxy s21`
                  clue: The person who is a doctor is the person who loves mystery books.
