      There are 2 houses, numbered 1 to 2 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each
      house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the    
      following characteristics:
      - Each person has a unique name: `Eric`, `Arnold`
      - Each person has a unique type of pet: `dog`, `cat`

      ## Clues:
      1. Eric is somewhere to the left of Arnold.
      2. The person who owns a dog is not in the first house.

                  Convert a single `clue` from a Zebra logic puzzle into Z3 constraints. The
                  uniqueness contraints from `context` are already encoded in the solver.
                  Each variable from `variable_names` is of type z3.Int() and
                  available for use in your output snippet. A value of a variable is the
                  number of the house that object occupies. Additionally, note that
                  `previous_snippets` are used for formalizing previous clues, and `step`
                  indicates the index of the current clue being formalized (0-based).

                  Return Python code wrapped in a triple-backtick block. The code must define
                  a list named `constraints` containing z3.BoolRef (if there is only one
                  constraint, then it is a one-element list) capturing only the information
                  from the provided clue. Do not modify the solver or call `check`. You must
                  prepend `z3.` to all Z3 API calls. Do not include any import statements.

                    There are 2 houses, numbered 1 to 2 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each
                    house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the    
                    following characteristics:
                    - Each person has a unique name: `Eric`, `Arnold`
                    - Each person has a unique type of pet: `dog`, `cat`
                  clue: Eric is somewhere to the left of Arnold.
