    Iteratively call a strategy or query, repeatedly feeding back the
    last call's output state into a new call and yielding values along
    the way.

    A standard use case is to repeatedly call a query or strategy with a
    blacklist of previously generated values, so as to produce diverse
    success values.

    Arguments:
        next: A parametric opaque space, induced by a query or stratey
            that takes a state as an input (or `None` initially) and
            outputs a new state, along with a generated value.
        transform_stream: An optional mapping from the inner policy to a
            stream transformer to be applied to the resulting stream of
            generated values.

    Returns:
        An opaque space enumerating all generated values.
